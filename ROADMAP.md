# DnDAcademy — Roadmap & Feature Backlog

Living document. Reprioritize freely. Add notes under each item as thinking evolves.

---

## Priority Queue

### ~~0a. Tests — Part 1: Data Integrity (Python)~~ ✅ Done
**Command:** `python tools/test.py` — also runs automatically from `start-map.bat`

44 checks across all registered campaigns: JSON parse validity, required entity fields, duplicate IDs, `related[]` resolution, `contentFile` existence on disk, `[[id]]` cross-link resolution, `dmPassHash` presence, and `fail-academy` registry exclusion. Failures print and set a non-zero exit code; server still starts.

**Also fixed during implementation:**
- `descent-into-avernus/data/index.json` — filenames were missing `.json` extensions; `references` was listed twice
- `curse-of-strahd` — `abbey_of_saint_markovia` existed in both `locations.json` and `factions.json`; faction renamed to `abbey_of_saint_markovia_faction`

---

### ~~0b. Tests — Part 2: JS Unit Tests (Browser)~~ ✅ Done
**URL:** `http://localhost:8000/tools/tests.html` (server must be running)

No campaign needed — mocks are inline. Approach: `window._genTest` added to the end of `generator.js`; `window._modalTest` added to end of `modal.js`. Non-breaking; easy to audit.

**Covers:**
- `generateNPC()` — required fields, `_meta`, unique ids, 200-roll secret probability
- Seeding — name override, gender pronouns, race recorded in `_meta`
- `rollOccupation()` — category/role always valid; common categories outnumber rare over 500 rolls
- `generateItem()` — required fields, rarity always one of four valid tiers (20 rolls)
- `mergeExt()` — append vs. replace; `_`-prefixed keys never written to T
- `makeLink()` — known id → `<a>`; unknown → `<span class="xlink-broken">`; custom labels honored
- `resolveCrossLinks()` — `[[id]]` and `[[id|label]]` replaced in DOM; broken ids show as broken spans; surrounding text preserved

---

### ~~1. Dice Roller — Multi-d20 Display (Advantage / Disadvantage)~~ ✅ Done

Auto-detect approach: any multi-roll of d20 shows individual die values side-by-side in both the stage and history; no sum shown. All other dice (2d6, etc.) still show a total. No UI decision needed during play.

---

### ~~2. NPC Generator — Quick Mode (Townsfolk / Shopkeeper)~~ ✅ Done

**⚡ Quick NPC** button in the topbar — one click opens a compact floating card. No form. Shows name, race/gender/occupation, one appearance note, one personality trait in italics. Re-roll generates a fresh NPC; Save persists it to the generator's saved list (same as full generator). Esc or click-outside dismisses. Full generator unchanged at `⚄ Generate`.

---

## Icebox (easiest → hardest)

- ~~**Remove dashboard subtitle**~~ ✅ Done — one-line fix in `makeHeader()`.
- ~~**Location bar → dashboard header**~~ ✅ Already done — `#location-bar` gone; back button, time toggle, Full Entry all inline in `makeHeader()`.
- **App rename** — pick a new name; mechanical find/replace across HTML/JS/CSS.
- **5e-bits API research** — evaluate https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/ for spell lookup, monster stat blocks, etc. Pure research, no code. Must be gracefully optional (DM-triggered; fails silently offline).
- ~~**Search improvements**~~ ✅ Done — tag search, multi-word AND matching, score-based ranking.
- ~~**Persistent DM state**~~ ✅ Already done — notes, revealed flags, session completion, location, and time all persisted via localStorage.
- **Session runner image panel** — split bottom of session runner into thirds; center panel cycles images (← →) from related image entities. Medium effort.
- ~~**Random generator expansion**~~ ✅ Done — added "Tables" third tab with Weather (weighted conditions + detail) and Encounter (4 environments: Road, Wilderness, Town, Dungeon) roll tables.
- **Color scheme — contrast overhaul** — many backgrounds are too close in color; add more contrast and some lighter surfaces. Review all panel/modal/overlay backgrounds.
- ~~**Player vs DM view**~~ ✅ Already done — `isVisible()` gates on `visibility:"player"` AND `isRevealed()`; dm-only blocks hidden in player mode; toggle + badge in topbar.
- **Import process overhaul** — CoS and DiA are sparse stubs; define content standard per entity type, richer templates, semi-automate Google Doc → JSON+HTML stub. One campaign at a time. Large effort.
- **Party overview page** — new panel/page: party members, HP, conditions, inventory. Needs data model + persistent state. Large effort.
