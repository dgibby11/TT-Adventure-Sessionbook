# TT Adventure Sessionbook — Roadmap & Feature Backlog

Living document. Reprioritize freely. Add notes under each item as thinking evolves.

---

## Priority Queue

### ~~0a. Tests — Part 1: Data Integrity (Python)~~ ✅ Done
**Command:** `python tools/test.py` — also runs automatically from `start-map.bat`

44 checks across all registered campaigns: JSON parse validity, required entity fields, duplicate IDs, `related[]` resolution, `contentFile` existence on disk, `[[id]]` cross-link resolution, `dmPassHash` presence, and `fail-academy` registry exclusion. Failures print and set a non-zero exit code; server still starts.

**Also fixed during implementation:**
- `descent-into-avernus/data/index.json` — filenames were missing `.json` extensions; `references` was listed twice
- `curse-of-strahd` — `abbey_of_saint_markovia` existed in both `locations.json` and `factions.json`; faction renamed to `abbey_of_saint_markovia_faction`

---

### ~~0b. Tests — Part 2: JS Unit Tests (Browser)~~ ✅ Done
**URL:** `http://localhost:8000/tools/tests.html` (server must be running)

No campaign needed — mocks are inline. Approach: `window._genTest` added to the end of `generator.js`; `window._modalTest` added to end of `modal.js`. Non-breaking; easy to audit.

**Covers:**
- `generateNPC()` — required fields, `_meta`, unique ids, 200-roll secret probability
- Seeding — name override, gender pronouns, race recorded in `_meta`
- `rollOccupation()` — category/role always valid; common categories outnumber rare over 500 rolls
- `generateItem()` — required fields, rarity always one of four valid tiers (20 rolls)
- `mergeExt()` — append vs. replace; `_`-prefixed keys never written to T
- `makeLink()` — known id → `<a>`; unknown → `<span class="xlink-broken">`; custom labels honored
- `resolveCrossLinks()` — `[[id]]` and `[[id|label]]` replaced in DOM; broken ids show as broken spans; surrounding text preserved

---

### ~~1. Dice Roller — Multi-d20 Display (Advantage / Disadvantage)~~ ✅ Done

Auto-detect approach: any multi-roll of d20 shows individual die values side-by-side in both the stage and history; no sum shown. All other dice (2d6, etc.) still show a total. No UI decision needed during play.

---

### ~~2. NPC Generator — Quick Mode (Townsfolk / Shopkeeper)~~ ✅ Done

**⚡ Quick NPC** button in the topbar — one click opens a compact floating card. No form. Shows name, race/gender/occupation, one appearance note, one personality trait in italics. Re-roll generates a fresh NPC; Save persists it to the generator's saved list (same as full generator). Esc or click-outside dismisses. Full generator unchanged at `⚄ Generate`.

---

## Icebox (easiest → hardest)

- ~~**Remove dashboard subtitle**~~ ✅ Done — one-line fix in `makeHeader()`.
- ~~**Location bar → dashboard header**~~ ✅ Already done — `#location-bar` gone; back button, time toggle, Full Entry all inline in `makeHeader()`.
- ~~**App rename**~~ ✅ Done — renamed to **TT Adventure Sessionbook** across index.html, data.js, style.css, start-map.bat, tools, README, ROADMAP, CLAUDE.md. GitHub repo name (DnDAcademy) unchanged — rename that separately on GitHub if desired.
- ~~**5e-bits API research**~~ ✅ Done — SRD REST API (dnd5eapi.co) and Open5e are both viable. Most useful endpoint: `/monsters/{index}` for stat blocks. Verdict: low priority — SRD content is thin (no campaign-specific monsters) and offline-first means silent failures during sessions. If implemented, best as an optional "Look up stat block →" button on creature entities. Not worth building until content gaps are felt at the table.
- ~~**Search improvements**~~ ✅ Done — tag search, multi-word AND matching, score-based ranking.
- ~~**Persistent DM state**~~ ✅ Already done — notes, revealed flags, session completion, location, and time all persisted via localStorage.
- ~~**Session runner image panel**~~ — removed from active icebox. Cold storage: the idea was to split the bottom of the session runner into thirds with a center image cycler. Shelved indefinitely.
- ~~**Random generator expansion**~~ ✅ Done — added "Tables" third tab with Weather (weighted conditions + detail) and Encounter (4 environments: Road, Wilderness, Town, Dungeon) roll tables.
- **Color scheme — contrast overhaul** — *partially done:* the dashboard ground is now parchment (`--paper`) while the quads stay dark, so panels no longer blur into the background once they fill with data; the chrome sitting on it (title, meta, Full Entry, time-of-day buttons) was re-pointed to the sepia scale, scoped under `#dashboard`. Still to review: modal/overlay backgrounds, the Session Runner's own panels, and the menu/topbar surfaces.
- **Settings modal** — a `⚙ Settings` button/link in the topbar's upper-right opening a modal of user options. First occupant: **theme / color scheme** selection, so the parchment-vs-dark work above becomes a choice rather than a hard-coded edit (dark, parchment, and room for more). Build it as a general settings surface, not a theme picker — future options land here rather than accreting more topbar buttons. Needs: a settings store in `localStorage` (alongside the existing campaign state), theme as a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` with the palette moved into per-theme `:root` blocks, and a modal shell reusing the existing one. Candidates for later: default view (DM/player), font size, which dashboard quadrants show, time-of-day default.
- ~~**Player vs DM view**~~ ✅ Already done — `isVisible()` gates on `visibility:"player"` AND `isRevealed()`; dm-only blocks hidden in player mode; toggle + badge in topbar.
- **Import process overhaul** — CoS and DiA are sparse stubs; define content standard per entity type, richer templates, semi-automate Google Doc → JSON+HTML stub. One campaign at a time. Large effort.
- **Party overview page** — new panel/page: party members, HP, conditions, inventory. Needs data model + persistent state. Large effort.
