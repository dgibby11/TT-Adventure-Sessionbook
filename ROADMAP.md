# DnDAcademy — Roadmap & Feature Backlog

Living document. Reprioritize freely. Add notes under each item as thinking evolves.

---

## Priority Queue

### ~~0a. Tests — Part 1: Data Integrity (Python)~~ ✅ Done
**Command:** `python tools/test.py` — also runs automatically from `start-map.bat`

44 checks across all registered campaigns: JSON parse validity, required entity fields, duplicate IDs, `related[]` resolution, `contentFile` existence on disk, `[[id]]` cross-link resolution, `dmPassHash` presence, and `fail-academy` registry exclusion. Failures print and set a non-zero exit code; server still starts.

**Also fixed during implementation:**
- `descent-into-avernus/data/index.json` — filenames were missing `.json` extensions; `references` was listed twice
- `curse-of-strahd` — `abbey_of_saint_markovia` existed in both `locations.json` and `factions.json`; faction renamed to `abbey_of_saint_markovia_faction`

---

### ~~0b. Tests — Part 2: JS Unit Tests (Browser)~~ ✅ Done
**URL:** `http://localhost:8000/tools/tests.html` (server must be running)

No campaign needed — mocks are inline. Approach: `window._genTest` added to the end of `generator.js`; `window._modalTest` added to end of `modal.js`. Non-breaking; easy to audit.

**Covers:**
- `generateNPC()` — required fields, `_meta`, unique ids, 200-roll secret probability
- Seeding — name override, gender pronouns, race recorded in `_meta`
- `rollOccupation()` — category/role always valid; common categories outnumber rare over 500 rolls
- `generateItem()` — required fields, rarity always one of four valid tiers (20 rolls)
- `mergeExt()` — append vs. replace; `_`-prefixed keys never written to T
- `makeLink()` — known id → `<a>`; unknown → `<span class="xlink-broken">`; custom labels honored
- `resolveCrossLinks()` — `[[id]]` and `[[id|label]]` replaced in DOM; broken ids show as broken spans; surrounding text preserved

---

### ~~1. Dice Roller — Multi-d20 Display (Advantage / Disadvantage)~~ ✅ Done

Auto-detect approach: any multi-roll of d20 shows individual die values side-by-side in both the stage and history; no sum shown. All other dice (2d6, etc.) still show a total. No UI decision needed during play.

---

### ~~2. NPC Generator — Quick Mode (Townsfolk / Shopkeeper)~~ ✅ Done

**⚡ Quick NPC** button in the topbar — one click opens a compact floating card. No form. Shows name, race/gender/occupation, one appearance note, one personality trait in italics. Re-roll generates a fresh NPC; Save persists it to the generator's saved list (same as full generator). Esc or click-outside dismisses. Full generator unchanged at `⚄ Generate`.

### 3. Import Process Overhaul
**Status:** Not started  
**Effort:** Large

Current state: Curse of Strahd and Descent Into Avernus imports are sparse — bare entity stubs, weak cross-links, and content that doesn't reflect the actual source material well. The import pipeline (Google Docs → local HTML fragments) needs a systematic rethink.

**Problems to solve:**
- Entity coverage is incomplete (major NPCs, locations, factions missing or stubbed)
- Content files are thin — not enough detail to be useful at the table
- Cross-links (`related[]` and `[[id]]` inline links) are sparse; the entity graph isn't navigable
- No consistent template for what a "good" NPC, location, or faction entry looks like
- No process for updating entries as the campaign progresses

**Ideas to explore:**
- Define a content standard per entity type (what fields/sections a complete entry has)
- Build a richer import template or checklist for each campaign
- Consider a semi-automated approach: structured Google Doc → JSON + HTML stub generator
- Separate "lore entries" (static background) from "session notes" (DM scratch) more clearly

This is the highest-leverage improvement for actual play value but requires the most upfront work. Tackle one campaign at a time.

---

### 4. Location Bar — Consolidate into Dashboard Header
**Status:** Not started  
**Effort:** Small

The location bar (`#location-bar`) sits below the top bar and above the dashboard panels, eating vertical space with information that duplicates or belongs in the dashboard header. Options:

- Merge the "◎ Campaign Home / ◎ Location Name" indicator into `.dash-location-header` as a breadcrumb or subtitle
- Move the ← Campaign Home back-button into the header as a button (already has a `Full Entry →` button there)
- Move the time-of-day toggle into the header row (compact pill row)
- Remove the separate location bar element entirely, recovering ~2rem of vertical space above the panels

Goal: the four quadrant panels start higher on the page, with all navigation controls inline in the header.

---

### 5. Images — Session Image Panel + Entity Portraits
**Status:** Not started  
**Effort:** Medium (per campaign) + Small (session panel layout)

Two related tracks:

**4a. Session runner image panel**  
Split the bottom half of the session runner into thirds (mirroring the top three panels). The center bottom panel shows images associated with the session, cycled with ← → arrows. If the session has no images, the panel is hidden and the adjacent two panels expand to fill the space. Images would be stored as a `images: ["path/to/img.jpg", ...]` array on the session entity (or sourced from related entities with `contentType: "image"`). The layout change is small; the main effort is content — sourcing scene/encounter art.

**4b. Entity image assets**  
Add visual assets for high-value entities: town maps, NPC portraits, magic item art, set-piece location art.

`contentType: "image"` already renders a full-width image in the modal — purely a content pipeline task. Priorities: recurring villains (Strahd, Zariel), key locations, party-acquired items.

---

## Icebox (easiest → hardest)

- **Remove dashboard subtitle** — strip `campaign.subtitle` (e.g. "Sword Coast — Characters Level 1–5") from the `dash-location-header` meta line; one-line change in `makeHeader()`.
- **App rename** — the tool has outgrown the "FAIL Academy" concept and is now a general D&D campaign dossier. Pick a new name; mechanical find/replace across HTML/JS/CSS.
- **5e-bits API research** — evaluate https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/ for integration opportunities: spell lookup, monster stat blocks, equipment, classes/spells by level. Pure research, no code. Any API use must be gracefully optional (DM explicitly triggers; fails silently offline).
- **Search improvements** — tag-based filtering, fuzzy match on existing search UI.
- **Persistent DM state** — notes, revealed flags, session log (partially done via localStorage; needs UI to expose it cleanly).
- **Random generator expansion** — extend beyond NPC/item: encounter tables, weather, rumors, names.
- **Player vs DM view** — full screen-safe player mode; DM toggle exists but content gating is not fully built out.
- **Party overview page** — new panel/page: track party members, HP, conditions, inventory. Needs a data model and persistent state.

## Completed

- **JS unit tests** (`tools/tests.html`) — 22 browser tests: generator logic, modal cross-link rendering
- **Data integrity test suite** (`tools/test.py`) — 44 checks, auto-runs on server launch
- Multi-campaign support with launcher and registry gating
- NPC generator (full mode) with race-specific names, weighted occupations, optional secrets
- Animated dice roller with d4–d100 support and throw animation
- Session runner panel
- Dashboard with 4-quadrant location view
- Entity cross-links (`[[id]]`) and related entity graph
